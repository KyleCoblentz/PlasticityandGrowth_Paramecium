# PlasticityandGrowth_Paramecium
Repository for Analysis of Paramecium Phenotypic Plasticity with Temperature and Growth Relationships

This repository currently contains the following files:

Plast_StartPop_Data.csv -- This csv file contains morphological and movement data for 20 outcrossed lines of paramecium that were grown for two days at seven different temperatures.

StartPop_TPC.csv -- This csv file contains growth rate data for the same 20 outcrossed lines in the Plast_StartPop_Data.csv file across seven different temperatures.

PlasticityAnalysis.R -- This R file is a work in progress. The goal of the analyses in this file is to characterize the plasticity of paramecium phenotypes in response to temperature across the 20 lines.
